Deep learning is one such technique that contributes to developers enhancing machines. To memorize how a task is performed, what do humans do? Humans keep practicing and repeating that task again and again so that they get proficient in that task. After some time our brain neurons can automatically trigger and perform the task quickly and accurately. Likewise, deep learning follows the approach to solving a problem. Various types of neural network architectures are used by deep learning algorithms to solve different types of problems.
