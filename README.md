Handwritten digit recognition with MNIST and Keras
This repository is for practice of implementing well-known network architectures and ensembling methods, including the followings:

Architectures
Mobilenet - [structure] [training progress]
VGG16 - [structure] [training progress]
Resnet164 - [structure] [training progress]
WideResnet28-10 - [structure] [training progress]

Ensembling methods
Unweighted average
Majority voting
Super Learner - [structure]

Others
Channel-wise normalization of input images: substracted by mean and divided by std
Data augmentation: rotation, width shift, height shift, shearing, zooming

Environment
MacOS High Sierra 10.13.1 for implementation / Ubuntu 14.04 for training
Python 3.6.3
Keras 2.1.2 (Tensorflow backend)
